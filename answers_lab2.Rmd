# Solution for the Laboratory 2

This is an R Markdown document including the solutions to the laboratory 2 for the Data Driven Security subject of the Master in CyberSecurity Management.

## Exploring the CPE Standard

Using the functions implemented in the file `cpe.R`, it is possible to create a data frame containing the following columns:

```{r file_load, error=FALSE}
# source("./cpe.R")
# df <- ParseCPEData()
```

Complete previously defined functions so that the package allows the generation of a data frame containing the data parsed from the CPE XML file.

```{r colnames, include=FALSE}
colnames(df)
```

Including fields such as...


```{r important_columns, include=FALSE}

```
